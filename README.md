This web application is supposed to give a user the ability to run their own blog. I created a homepage to show the blog entries. On the top right is a link to the login page. After entering the correct username and password, you will be redirected to the dashboard. The dashboard is like the homepage, except edit and delete buttons have been added for each entry as well as a link to add a post.
